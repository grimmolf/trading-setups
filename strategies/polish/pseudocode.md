# Polish Strategy - Pseudocode

## Strategy Overview

**Name**: Polish Strategy  
**Type**: Trend-Following with Structure Confirmation  
**Target**: Day trading with 4.669 extension profit targets  
**Creator**: Grimm's Polish Dogs concept  

## Core Concept

The Polish strategy combines smoothed moving average trend confirmation with W/M pattern structure to identify high-probability trend-following entries during active trading sessions.

## Three-Step Entry System

### Step 1: Location (Time-Based Filtering)
- **Purpose**: Filter trades to optimal market hours
- **Component**: Active trading session window
- **Logic**: Only take trades during specified market hours

### Step 2: Momentum (Moving Average Stack)
- **Purpose**: Confirm trend direction and strength
- **Component**: Three smoothed moving averages (21, 50, 200 periods)
- **Logic**: 
  - **Bullish**: SMMA21 > SMMA50 > SMMA200 (stack alignment)
  - **Bearish**: SMMA21 < SMMA50 < SMMA200 (stack alignment)

### Step 3: Structure (Pattern Confirmation)
- **Purpose**: Wait for specific price structures before entry
- **Component**: W/M patterns or RSI momentum confirmation
- **Logic**: 
  - **W Pattern**: Double bottom formation (bullish reversal)
  - **M Pattern**: Double top formation (bearish reversal)
  - **RSI Filter**: Above 50 for bullish, below 50 for bearish

## Detailed Entry Logic

### Bullish Entry Conditions
```
1. LOCATION: Within active trading session
2. MOMENTUM: 
   - SMMA21 > SMMA50 > SMMA200 (bullish stack)
   - Close > SMMA200 (price above long-term trend)
3. STRUCTURE:
   - W pattern detected in recent price action, OR
   - RSI(14) >= 50 (momentum above midline)
   - Price pullback to or below SMMA50 (retest opportunity)
```

### Bearish Entry Conditions  
```
1. LOCATION: Within active trading session
2. MOMENTUM:
   - SMMA21 < SMMA50 < SMMA200 (bearish stack)
   - Close < SMMA200 (price below long-term trend)
3. STRUCTURE:
   - M pattern detected in recent price action, OR
   - RSI(14) <= 50 (momentum below midline)
   - Price pullback to or above SMMA50 (retest opportunity)
```

## Pattern Recognition

### W Pattern (Double Bottom)
```
1. Identify two similar lows within recent price action
2. Lows must be within 2% of each other
3. Higher low between the two lows
4. Current price breaks above pattern resistance
5. Volume confirmation preferred
```

### M Pattern (Double Top)
```
1. Identify two similar highs within recent price action
2. Highs must be within 2% of each other
3. Lower high between the two highs
4. Current price breaks below pattern support
5. Volume confirmation preferred
```

## Risk Management

### Stop Loss Placement
```
For Long Trades:
- Initial Stop: Below recent swing low (typically 3-bar minimum)
- Trailing Stop: Move to SMMA200 when price moves favorably
- Maximum Risk: 2% of account per trade

For Short Trades:
- Initial Stop: Above recent swing high (typically 3-bar maximum)
- Trailing Stop: Move to SMMA200 when price moves favorably
- Maximum Risk: 2% of account per trade
```

### Position Sizing
```
Risk_Amount = Account_Value × 0.02 (2% risk)
Stop_Distance = |Entry_Price - Stop_Loss_Price|
Position_Size = Risk_Amount / Stop_Distance
```

## Profit Targets

### Primary Target: 4.669 Extension
```
For Long Trades:
- Measure from right-hand low to right-hand high of W pattern
- Apply 4.669 extension from pattern completion point
- Target = Pattern_High + ((Pattern_High - Pattern_Low) × 4.669)

For Short Trades:
- Measure from right-hand high to right-hand low of M pattern
- Apply 4.669 extension from pattern completion point
- Target = Pattern_Low - ((Pattern_High - Pattern_Low) × 4.669)
```

### Alternative Target: 2.618 Extension
```
For partial position management:
- Move stop to break-even when price hits 2.618 extension
- Take partial profits at 2.618 level
- Let remainder run to 4.669 target
```

## Exit Conditions

### Stop Loss Exits
```
1. Price breaks below stop loss level
2. Moving average stack breaks down (trend reversal)
3. RSI momentum divergence signals
4. End of trading session approached
```

### Profit Taking Exits
```
1. 4.669 extension target reached (full exit)
2. 2.618 extension reached (partial exit, move stop to BE)
3. Reversal pattern forms at target area
4. Strong counter-trend momentum appears
```

## Session Management

### Trading Session Parameters
```
Primary Session: 8:30 AM - 12:00 PM (configurable timezone)
Analysis Window: 7:00 AM - 8:30 AM (preparation period)
Session Days: Monday through Friday
Weekend Trading: Disabled (market closed)
```

### Session Rules
```
1. Only enter new positions during active session
2. Close all positions before session end
3. No overnight holding
4. Reduce position size near session end
```

## Additional Filters

### Volume Confirmation
```
- Above-average volume on pattern breakout
- Volume expansion on entry signal
- Volume contraction during pullback phases
```

### Market Condition Filters
```
- Avoid during major news releases
- Reduce size during high volatility periods
- Increase size during trending market conditions
- Pause trading during ranging/choppy markets
```

## Implementation Notes

### Moving Average Calculation (SMMA)
```
SMMA[i] = (SMMA[i-1] × (Period - 1) + Price[i]) / Period
Initial SMMA = SMA(Price, Period)
```

### Pattern Detection Window
```
Lookback Period: 7-15 bars
Pattern Similarity: 2% tolerance
Minimum Pattern Size: 1 ATR
Maximum Pattern Age: 20 bars
```

### Risk Controls
```
Maximum Daily Loss: 6% of account
Maximum Concurrent Positions: 1
Correlation Limit: N/A (single position)
Drawdown Limit: 15% (pause trading)
```

## Performance Expectations

### Expected Statistics
```
Win Rate: 40-55% (trend-following characteristics)
Average Win: 4.669R (by design)
Average Loss: 1.0R (risk management)
Profit Factor: 2.0-3.0 (estimated)
Maximum Drawdown: 15-20%
```

### Optimization Parameters
```
Optimizable:
- Moving average periods (18-25, 45-55, 180-220)
- Pattern detection window (5-20 bars)
- Extension ratios (3.618-6.854)
- Session timing (±1 hour flexibility)

Fixed:
- Risk percentage (2% standard)
- Pattern similarity tolerance (2%)
- Session day filters (weekdays only)
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
```
1. False Pattern Detection:
   - Increase similarity threshold
   - Require volume confirmation
   - Add minimum pattern size filter

2. Whipsaws in Ranging Markets:
   - Add trend strength filter
   - Increase minimum move size
   - Use higher timeframe confirmation

3. Late Entries:
   - Reduce pattern detection lag
   - Use real-time pattern validation
   - Add momentum acceleration filter
```

### Contingency Plans
```
1. System Failure: Manual monitoring with predefined levels
2. Market Gaps: Adjust position size for gap risk
3. News Events: Pause trading during major announcements
4. Extended Drawdown: Reduce position size by 50%
```
