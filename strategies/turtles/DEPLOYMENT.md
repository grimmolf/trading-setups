## Risk Management Implementation

### Account Configuration

#### Position Sizing Framework
```
Standard Configuration:
- Risk per trade: $50 fixed (or 2% of account)
- Maximum risk: 2% of account balance
- Position calculation: Risk ÷ Stop Distance
- Maximum positions: 1-2 at any time
- Daily risk limit: $150 (3 trades max)
- Weekly risk limit: $250 (5 trades max)
```

#### Progressive Sizing Model
```
Account Size | Risk per Trade | Max Positions | Daily Limit
$2,500      | $25           | 1            | $75
$5,000      | $50           | 1            | $150
$10,000     | $100          | 2            | $300
$25,000     | $250          | 2            | $750
$50,000     | $500          | 3            | $1,500
```

### Risk Control Implementation

#### Platform-Level Controls
1. **TradingView**: Set up risk monitoring alerts
2. **ThinkOrSwim**: Configure position size limits
3. **Broker**: Set daily loss limits
4. **Account**: Maintain 75% cash reserves

#### Automated Risk Management
- **Position Sizing**: Risk Amount ÷ Stop Distance
