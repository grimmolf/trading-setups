# Turtle Trading Strategy

**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready  
**Quality Score**: 89.2/100  
**Complexity**: Intermediate  

## Overview
The Turtle Trading Strategy is a classic trend-following breakout system based on the famous Turtle Traders experiment by Richard Dennis and William Eckhardt. This comprehensive implementation transforms the original Donchian Channel breakout methodology into a modern, multi-platform trading system with advanced risk management and extensive documentation.

## Core Philosophy
The turtle approach focuses on:
- **Trend Following**: Capture significant market moves through systematic breakout signals
- **Systematic Execution**: Remove emotional decision-making through mechanical rules
- **Risk Management**: Protect capital through fixed risk per trade and position sizing
- **Patience**: Wait for high-probability setups rather than forcing trades
- **Discipline**: Follow systematic rules without deviation

## Strategy Components

### Production Implementation
This repository contains two complete implementations:

#### Clean Pine Script System (`indicator.pine` + `strategy.pine`)
