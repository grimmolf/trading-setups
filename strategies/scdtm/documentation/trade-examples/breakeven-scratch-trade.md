## Alternative Management Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Pure Systematic Approach
**Alternative**: Hold position until stop ($2,284) or target ($2,475.75)
- **Likely Outcome**: Stop loss eventually hit for -1R
- **Market Action**: Range-bound conditions would likely test stops
- **System Integrity**: Maintains pure systematic approach
- **Risk**: Full $50 loss vs $1.29 profit achieved

### Scenario 2: Breakeven Stop Move
**Alternative**: Move stop to breakeven after reaching 1:1 level
- **Breakeven Level**: $2,343 + $59 = $2,402 (never reached)
- **Outcome**: Same as current (manual exit required)
- **System Modification**: Would require strategy enhancement
- **Impact**: No change to this specific trade

### Scenario 3: Partial Profit Taking
**Alternative**: Take 50% profit at 1.5:1 level, let rest run
- **Partial Level**: $2,343 + ($59 × 1.5) = $2,431.50 (never reached)
- **Outcome**: Same as current result
- **Strategy Change**: Would require partial exit rules
- **Complexity**: Increases system complexity significantly

### Scenario 4: Time-Based Exit
**Alternative**: Exit after predetermined time limit (e.g., 24 hours)
- **Exit Timing**: Would have exited 2 hours later
- **Likely Price**: Similar to actual exit around $2,345
- **System Addition**: Would require time-based rules
- **Effectiveness**: Similar outcome to manual decision
