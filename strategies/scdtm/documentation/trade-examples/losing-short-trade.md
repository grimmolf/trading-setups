**Bear EMA Index**: 3/3 (Perfect bearish alignment)  
**Assessment**: Strong institutional bearish configuration across all timeframes

### Checkpoint 2: Bollinger Band %B and Stochastic RSI

#### Bollinger Band %B Analysis
- **Calculation Setup**: 20-period, 2.0 standard deviations
- **Current Price**: $3,390
- **Upper Band**: $3,520
- **Lower Band**: $3,260
- **Basis (SMA 20)**: $3,390
- **%B Value**: 1.12 (significantly overbought)

**%B Signal Logic**:
- **Threshold**: %B ≥ 1.00 for short signal activation
- **Current Status**: %B = 1.12 (well above overbought threshold)
- **3 Bars Ago**: %B = 1.08 (triggered short signal)
- **Signal State**: **SHORT BBR = 1** ✅

**%B Signal Quality**:
- **Overbought Reading**: Clear rejection from upper band
- **Mean Reversion Setup**: Price extended above normal range
- **Distribution Signs**: Multiple touches of upper band without follow-through

- Bear EMA Index: 3 ✅
- Short BBR: 1 ✅  
- Short RSI: 1 ✅

#### Checkpoint 2 Result: ✅ PASSED
**Assessment**: Excellent mean reversion setup with momentum confirmation for short

### Checkpoint 3: Fractal Pattern Recognition

#### Fractal Detection Setup
- **Fractal Type**: 5-bar fractal (higher reliability)
- **Periods (n)**: 2
- **Scan Window**: Looking for down fractal formation

#### Down Fractal Analysis
**Pattern Recognition** (5-bar down fractal):
- **Bar [n-2]**: High = $3,480 < Target High
- **Bar [n-1]**: High = $3,465 < Target High  
- **Bar [n]**: High = $3,525 (Fractal High) ✅
- **Bar [n+1]**: High = $3,470 < Target High
- **Bar [n+2]**: High = $3,455 < Target High

**Fractal Validation**:
- **Formation**: Perfect 5-bar down fractal ✅
- **Location**: $3,525 represents clear resistance level
- **Context**: Formed at key resistance zone with distribution
- **Volume**: High volume on fractal high (selling pressure)

#### Trend Alignment Check
- **Bear EMA Index**: 3 (required for down fractal validity)
- **Trade State**: 0 (no active trade)
- **Fractal Direction**: Downward (matches bearish bias)

#### Additional Pattern Analysis
- **Resistance Confluence**: Fractal high near previous support turned resistance
- **Fibonacci**: 61.8% retracement of recent decline (common reversal zone)
- **Volume**: Heavy selling volume on fractal formation
- **Multiple Rejections**: Third rejection from $3,520-$3,530 zone

#### Checkpoint 3 Result: ✅ PASSED
**Bear Fractal Valid**: TRUE  
**Assessment**: High-quality fractal formation with strong resistance confluence

### Checkpoint 4: Setup Persistence and Level Calculation

#### Fractal Level Calculations
**Entry Setup** (Bear Fractal):
- **Fractal High**: $3,525 (identified resistance)
- **Fractal Low**: $3,355 (breakdown confirmation level)
- **Bear Breakout Price**: $3,355 - $1.00 (1 tick) = $3,354.00
- **Bear Fractal Stop**: $3,525 + $1.00 (1 tick) = $3,526.00

#### Risk Distance Calculation
**Risk Distance**: $3,526.00 - $3,354.00 = **$172**

#### Target Calculation  
**Risk/Reward Ratio**: 2.25:1 (strategy default)
**Bear Target**: $3,354.00 - ($172 × 2.25) = **$2,967.00**

#### Position Sizing Calculation
**Risk Amount**: $50 (strategy standard)
**Position Size**: $50 ÷ $172 = **0.291 ETH**
**Position Value**: $3,354.00 × 0.291 = **$976**

#### Trade State Management
- **Previous State**: 0 (No trade)
- **New State**: 1 (Setup pending breakout)
- **CP4 Status**: 1 (Persistent signal active)

#### Level Summary
- **Entry**: $3,354.00 (breakdown level)
- **Stop**: $3,526.00 (risk control)
- **Target**: $2,967.00 (profit objective)
- **Risk**: $172 per ETH ($50 total)
- **Reward**: $387 per ETH ($112.50 total)

#### Checkpoint 4 Result: ✅ PASSED
**Assessment**: All levels calculated, setup ready for breakdown confirmation

### Checkpoint 5: Breakout Confirmation and Entry

#### Breakdown Monitoring
**Setup Status**: CP4 active, waiting for price to break $3,354.00

#### Market Development
**Time**: 09:15 GMT (1.5 hours after fractal formation)
**Price Action**: Consolidation below fractal high, building selling pressure

#### Breakdown Execution
**Trigger Time**: 09:28 GMT
**Trigger Event**: Price low touches $3,353 (breaks below breakdown level)
**EMA Alignment Check**: Bear EMA Index = 3 (≥2 required) ✅
**Volume Confirmation**: 1.8x average volume on breakdown bar

#### Entry Execution
**Entry Method**: Stop order triggered at breakdown level
**Entry Price**: $3,354.00 (exact breakdown level)
**Position Size**: 0.291 ETH (as calculated)
**Slippage**: $0 (perfect fill)

#### Trade State Update
- **Previous State**: 1 (Setup pending)
- **New State**: 3 (Short active)
- **CP5 Status**: 1 (Entry confirmed)

#### Checkpoint 5 Result: ✅ PASSED
**Assessment**: Clean breakdown execution with volume confirmation
