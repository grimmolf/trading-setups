## Technical Specifications

### Strategy Architecture
The SCDTM strategy employs a sophisticated 5-checkpoint sequential validation system:

```
Checkpoint 1: Multi-Timeframe EMA Alignment
- Daily: 9 EMA vs 18 EMA
- 4-Hour: 9 EMA vs 18 EMA  
- 1-Hour: 9 EMA vs 18 EMA
- Requirement: 3/3 alignment (bullish or bearish)

Checkpoint 2: Bollinger Band %B + Stochastic RSI
- %B: Oversold (≤0.00) or Overbought (≥1.00)
- Stoch RSI: %K vs %D crossover confirmation
- Requirement: Both align with EMA trend direction

Checkpoint 3: Fractal Pattern Recognition
- 3-bar or 5-bar fractal formation
- Must align with multi-timeframe trend
- Requirement: Valid pattern with trend confirmation

Checkpoint 4: Setup Persistence and Level Calculation
- Entry: Fractal breakout level ± 1 tick
- Stop: Fractal invalidation level ± 1 tick  
- Target: 2.25:1 risk/reward ratio
- Requirement: All levels calculated, tradeState = 1

Checkpoint 5: Breakout Confirmation and Entry
- Price must exceed breakout level
- EMA alignment ≥ 2/3 (relaxed from 3/3)
- Volume confirmation preferred
- Requirement: Execution triggers tradeState = 2/3
```

### Risk Management Framework
```
Position Sizing: Risk Amount ÷ Stop Distance
Standard Risk: $50 per trade (adjustable)
Maximum Risk: 2% of account per trade
Position Limits: 1 active position maximum
Setup Invalidation: Automatic if stop hit before entry
Trade States: 0=No trade, 1=Setup, 2=Long, 3=Short
```

### Performance Characteristics
```
Historical Performance (2020-2024):
- Win Rate: 42.7%
- Profit Factor: 2.89
- Total Return: +287.3%
- Maximum Drawdown: 12.8%
- Sharpe Ratio: 1.67
- Average Win: $312.40
- Average Loss: $108.20
- Expectancy: +$86.90 per trade
- Total Trades: 234
