3. **Copy and paste** complete code from `/strategies/scdtm/pinescript/indicator.pine`
4. **Save Script** as "SCDTM Indicator v1.0"
5. **Add to Chart** and verify all checkpoint displays appear correctly
6. **Validate Multi-Timeframe** data by checking Daily/4H/1H EMA alignment

#### Strategy Deployment  
1. **Create New Strategy** script in Pine Editor

   - Fractal type: 5-bar (more reliable)
   - Use percent risk: false (for fixed dollar risk)
5. **Run Backtest** to verify performance matches documented results
6. **Configure Alerts** for checkpoint validation and entry signals

### Step 2: Alert Configuration

#### Comprehensive Alert Setup
```pinescript
// Entry alerts with full trade details
alertcondition(longEntry, "SCDTM Long Entry", 
    "LONG {{ticker}} | Entry: {{bull_breakout_price}} | Stop: {{bull_fractal_sl}} | Target: {{bull_target}} | Risk: ${{riskAmount}} | Size: {{positionSize}}")

    "SHORT {{ticker}} | Entry: {{bear_breakout_price}} | Stop: {{bear_fractal_sl}} | Target: {{bear_target}} | Risk: ${{riskAmount}} | Size: {{positionSize}}")

// Checkpoint status alerts
alertcondition(cp1, "SCDTM CP1 Active", "Checkpoint 1: EMA alignment achieved on {{ticker}}")
alertcondition(cp2, "SCDTM CP2 Active", "Checkpoint 2: %B + Stoch RSI aligned on {{ticker}}")
alertcondition(cp3, "SCDTM CP3 Active", "Checkpoint 3: Fractal pattern formed on {{ticker}}")
alertcondition(cp4, "SCDTM CP4 Active", "Checkpoint 4: Setup levels calculated on {{ticker}}")
```

#### Alert Management Strategy

  - Stochastic RSI
  - Volume for confirmation

#### Chart Workspace Setup
1. **Create Custom Layout** with 3-pane configuration
2. **Main Chart**: 1H timeframe with SCDTM strategy
3. **Upper Pane**: Multi-timeframe EMA status
4. **Lower Pane**: %B and Stochastic RSI oscillators
5. **Save Layout** as "SCDTM Trading Setup"

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Checkpoint Validation Problems
**Issue**: Checkpoints not activating in sequence
- **Solution**: Verify multi-timeframe data availability
- **Check**: TradingView Pro+ subscription for security() calls
- **Validate**: EMA calculations across all timeframes

**Issue**: Fractal patterns not detected
- **Solution**: Ensure sufficient price history loaded
- **Check**: Fractal period settings (2 periods default)
- **Validate**: Price action has sufficient volatility for pattern formation

#### Signal Generation Issues
**Issue**: No signals appearing despite apparent setups
- **Solution**: Verify all 5 checkpoints must pass simultaneously
- **Check**: tradeState = 0 requirement for new setups
- **Validate**: EMA alignment threshold (3/3 required)

**Issue**: False signals or poor performance
- **Solution**: Verify parameter settings match documented values
- **Check**: Risk/reward ratio set to 2.25
- **Validate**: Stop loss placement at fractal levels

#### Risk Management Failures
**Issue**: Position sizes not calculating correctly
- **Solution**: Verify risk amount and stop distance inputs
- **Check**: Account balance and risk percentage settings
- **Validate**: Mathematical calculation: Risk ÷ Stop Distance

**Issue**: Stops not triggering properly
- **Solution**: Ensure market orders for stop loss exits
- **Check**: Platform-specific stop loss implementation
- **Validate**: Slippage allowance in volatile markets

### Platform-Specific Issues

#### TradingView Problems
- **Multi-timeframe errors**: Upgrade to Pro+ subscription
- **Script errors**: Check Pine Script version compatibility
- **Alert failures**: Verify internet connection and notification settings
- **Performance issues**: Reduce chart complexity and indicators

#### ThinkOrSwim Problems
