## Risk Management

### Position Sizing

#### Basic Position Sizing

Position Size = (Account Balance × Risk%) / Stop Distance
Example: ($10,000 × 1%) / $50 = 2 shares
```

#### Advanced Position Sizing
```javascript
// Kelly Criterion
f = (bp - q) / b
Where:
f = fraction of capital to bet
b = odds received (reward/risk ratio)
p = probability of winning
q = probability of losing (1-p)
```

#### Risk Management Rules
```
1. Never risk more than 1% per trade
2. Maximum 5% total portfolio risk
3. No more than 3 concurrent positions
4. Reduce position size after losses
5. Increase size gradually after wins
```

### Stop Loss Management

#### Initial Stop Placement
```
Long Trades:
- Stop below pattern point B

- Consider ATR-based stops
- Never risk more than 1% of account

Short Trades:
- Stop above pattern point B
- Add 1% buffer for volatility
- Consider ATR-based stops
- Never risk more than 1% of account
```

#### Stop Loss Adjustment
```
Trailing Stop Rules:
1. Move stop to breakeven after 1:1 profit
2. Trail by 50% of favorable movement
3. Use previous swing points as guides
4. Never move stop against position
```

### Portfolio Management
