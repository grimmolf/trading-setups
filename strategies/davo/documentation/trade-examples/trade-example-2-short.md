## Post-Trade Analysis

### What Went Wrong
1. **Weak Pattern Quality**: M formation lacked clear structure
2. **Poor Confirmation**: Williams %R confirmation was weak
3. **Low Volume**: Breakdown had insufficient volume
4. **Strong Support**: Ignored nearby support level
5. **Market Conditions**: High volatility worked against position

```
Price Pattern: 6/10 (adequate but not strong)
Volume Confirmation: 5/10 (weak OBV signal)
Momentum Confirmation: 3/10 (poor Williams %R)
Entry Timing: 4/10 (too early, insufficient confirmation)
Risk Management: 10/10 (perfect execution)
```

### Key Failure Factors
1. **Market Conditions**: Strong uptrend still in place
2. **Pattern Quality**: Marginal M formation
3. **Volume Analysis**: Insufficient distribution volume
4. **Support Levels**: Failed to consider strong support
5. **Confirmation Quality**: Weak secondary confirmations

## Lessons Learned

2. **Strong Support**: $71,000 level provided strong support
3. **Trend Strength**: 4H uptrend still intact
4. **Divergence Quality**: Weak momentum divergence
5. **Market Volatility**: High volatility increased risk
