## Why The Trade Was Avoided

### Primary Disqualification
**Trend Alignment Failure**: Strategy requires 3/3 timeframes aligned
- **Required**: All timeframes bearish for short entry
- **Actual**: Only daily bearish, 4H and 1H bullish
- **Rule**: No trade without 3/3 alignment
- **Action**: Setup automatically disqualified

### Secondary Concerns
1. **Mixed Signals**: Conflicting timeframe directions
2. **High Volatility**: Elevated ATR suggests unstable conditions
3. **News Risk**: Fed Chair speech in 3 hours
4. **Session Timing**: London volatility can be unpredictable

### Risk Management Perspective
- **Probability**: Mixed signals reduce probability of success
- **Risk**: High volatility increases risk of whipsaws
- **Timing**: News events can override technical signals
- **Discipline**: Better to wait for clearer setup

## What Would Have Happened

### Hypothetical Trade Details
If the trade had been taken despite the filter:
- **Entry**: $1,970.50 (break below Low[1])
- **Stop Loss**: $1,975.50 (fractal high)
- **Take Profit**: $1,960.50 (2:1 R:R)
- **Risk**: $50 per ounce
- **Position Size**: $200 risk ÷ $50 = 4 ounces

### Actual Price Movement
1. **09:00**: Fractal formation identified
2. **10:00**: Price briefly drops to $1,969.80 (would have triggered entry)
3. **10:30**: Strong reversal to $1,974.20
4. **11:00**: Continued rally to $1,978.50
5. **12:00**: Fed Chair speech catalyst pushes to $1,982.30
6. **13:00**: Price reaches $1,985.70 (stop would have been hit)

### Hypothetical Results
- **Entry**: $1,970.50
- **Exit**: $1,975.50 (stop loss hit)
- **Loss**: $50 per ounce × 4 ounces = -$200
- **Outcome**: -1R loss (full risk taken)
- **Performance**: Negative impact on strategy statistics
