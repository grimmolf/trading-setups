- Identify platform-specific adjustments needed
- Plan indicator and strategy implementations

#### 3.3.2 Indicator Translation
- Create ThinkScript indicator: `strategies/[strategy-name]/thinkscript/indicator.ts`
- Translate Pine Script calculations to ThinkScript syntax
- Adapt visual elements for Thinkorswim
- Test functionality and accuracy

#### 3.3.3 Strategy Translation
- Create ThinkScript strategy: `strategies/[strategy-name]/thinkscript/strategy.ts`
- Implement order management logic
- Add risk controls appropriate for the platform
- Create scan conditions for strategy setup detection

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation

### 4.1 Initial Testing
- **Syntax Validation**: Ensure code compiles without errors
- **Logic Verification**: Confirm signals generate as expected
- **Alert Testing**: Verify alert messages format correctly
- **Visual Inspection**: Check that indicators display properly

### 4.2 Backtesting

#### 4.2.1 TradingView Backtesting
- Set up appropriate backtesting environment
- Configure commission and slippage settings
- Define backtesting period (minimum 2 years)
- Run comprehensive backtest across different market conditions

#### 4.2.2 Performance Analysis
- Analyze key metrics:
  - Win rate and profit factor
  - Average win/loss ratios
  - Maximum drawdown periods
  - Risk-adjusted returns
- Compare against buy-and-hold benchmark
- Identify periods of underperformance

#### 4.2.3 Parameter Optimization
- Test parameter sensitivity
- Avoid overfitting by using out-of-sample data
- Document optimal parameter ranges
- Create robustness testing framework

### 4.3 Forward Testing
- Implement strategy in paper trading environment
