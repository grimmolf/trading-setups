# Trading Setups Repository

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of trading strategies and setups, designed to take trading ideas from concept to implementation across multiple platforms. The goal is to systematically develop, test, and document trading strategies for use in various trading environments.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to take ideas for trading strategies and build them out into complete, production-ready trading systems. This includes:

- **Strategy Development**: Transform raw ideas into structured trading logic
- **Multi-Platform Implementation**: Create code for different trading platforms
- **Backtesting**: Validate strategies with historical data
- **Documentation**: Provide clear explanations and visual examples
- **Automation**: Enable automated trading through alerts and signals

## Strategy Development Workflow

### Input Sources
Trading strategies can originate from various sources:
- **PDF Documents**: Research papers, trading guides, strategy explanations
- **Pine Script Code**: Existing indicators or strategies (working or broken)
- **Text Descriptions**: Written explanations of trading concepts
- **YouTube Videos**: Educational content describing trading methods
- **Personal Ideas**: Original concepts or modifications of existing strategies

### Development Process
Each strategy goes through a structured development process:

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Understand the core concept
   - Identify entry/exit rules
   - Define risk management parameters
   - Document market conditions where strategy applies

2. **Pseudocode Development**
   - Create step-by-step logic description
   - Define all variables and conditions
   - Map out decision trees for entries and exits

3. **Multi-Platform Implementation**
   - **Pine Script Indicator**: For TradingView alerts and AutoView integration
   - **Pine Script Strategy**: For TradingView backtesting and optimization
   - **ThinkScript**: For TD Ameritrade/Thinkorswim platform
   - **Documentation PDF**: Complete strategy guide with examples

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Backtest across different market conditions
   - Optimize parameters
   - Document performance metrics
   - Create visual trade examples
